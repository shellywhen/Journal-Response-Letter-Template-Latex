	You forgot to cite a very important reference (where I am an author)!
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
	We are aware that citations on Google Scholar are very important to you.
	Therefore, we added reference \cite{ReviewerReference}.
	
	Also check out our article \cite{Besser2020}.
	
	\printpartbibliography{ReviewerReference,Besser2020}
	
	And btw, your Comment~\ref{comment:work-not-good} was mean!
